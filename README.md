## üëã Introduction
The Rated SDK (Software Development Kit) for Python, which allows Python developers to write software that makes use of the Rated dataset. You can find the latest, most up to date, documentation at our docs site.

The Rated SDK is maintained and published by Rated Labs.

We‚Äôve curated many examples which will help you kickstart your integration but to get a full list of all available endpoints, you are recommended to check out our API Reference and Swagger.

### Installation
Install using `pip`:
```bash
pip install rated-python
```

### Usage
**Example:** how to get a validator effectiveness rating by pubkey

```python
from rated import Rated
from rated.ethereum import MAINNET

RATED_KEY = "ey..."
r = Rated(RATED_KEY)
eth = r.ethereum(network=MAINNET)
for eff in eth.validator.effectiveness("0x123456789...", from_day=873, size=1): 
    print(f"Day: {eff.day}, Eff: {eff.validator_effectiveness}")

>>> Day: 873, Eff: 98.82005899705014
```

### Running tests
First install tox
```bash
pip install tox
```
Once tox has been installed you can run all tests:
